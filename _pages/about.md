# About

PURRLab research interests lie within the broad area of trustworthy machine learning and its applications to medical imaging with a focus on datasets.  We are particularly interested in understanding the similarity and diversity of datasets, methods for learning with limited labeled data such as transfer learning, and meta-research on machine learning in medical imaging.

The best way to get a sense of what’s currently going on in the lab is to read about our [people](https://purrlab.github.io/people/) and [projects](https://purrlab.github.io/projects/).

PURRLab is a part of [DASYA](https://dasya.itu.dk/) research group in the department of Computer Science at the IT University of Copenhagen and is led by Veronika Cheplygina.

PURRLab research is being supported by the Dutch Research Council, Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Independent Research Council of Denmark.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
