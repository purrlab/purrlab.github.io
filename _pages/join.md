## BSc and MSc projects at ITU

At PURRlab we are working on improving the use of machine learning in medical image analysis. You can find highlighted example of previous student projects on the [projects page](https://purrlab.github.io/projects/). You can also find more examples on our github [https://github.com/purrlab](https://github.com/purrlab)

More information about what it's like to join the lab, and general resources for students are available in our [Lab guide on Notion](https://vcheplygina.notion.site/Lab-guide-PURRlab-at-ITU-c85f30c838f1447780773a456cf35fcd?pvs=74).

### Interested in doing a project with us?

We are not supervising project in fall 2025 due to Veronika's sabbatical and several people leaving the lab. For spring 2025, please check this page later in the semester for available topics, and after that email Veronika.
