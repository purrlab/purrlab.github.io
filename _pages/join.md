## BSc and MSc projects at ITU


At PURRlab we are doing meta-research on the use of machine learning, often in medical image analysis. To learn more about the research directions, check out our [publications](https://purrlab.github.io/publications/). You can find highlighted example of previous student projects on the [projects page](https://purrlab.github.io/projects/). You can also find more examples on our github [https://github.com/purrlab](https://github.com/purrlab)

More information about what it's like to join the lab, and general resources for students are available in our [Lab guide on Notion](https://vcheplygina.notion.site/Lab-guide-PURRlab-at-ITU-c85f30c838f1447780773a456cf35fcd?pvs=74).

Here are some project ideas available for BSc and MSc students from spring 2026:

## Open PhD or postdoc positions

There are two open postdoc positions (deadline 31 January 2026) in the CHEETAH project, focusing on inclusion in machine learning competitions. Read more about the project and how to apply [here](https://candidate.hr-manager.net/ApplicationInit.aspx?cid=119&ProjectId=181837&DepartmentId=3439&MediaId=5)!

All positions are advertised through the [official ITU vacancy page](https://en.itu.dk/About-ITU/Vacancies). There you can sign up to receive notifications about new positions.
