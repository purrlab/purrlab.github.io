description: Beatrix M. G. Nielsen is a postdoc at the IT University of Copenhagen interested in understanding the representations of machine learning models. She has worked on figuring out how clustering works in high dimensions and what distances between probability distributions of models can tell us about how similar their representations are. Before she joined ITU, she did a bachelor's and master's in mathematics at the University of Copenhagen, spent some time in industry as a software developer and data scientist and did a PhD at the Technical University of Denmark.
