description: I’m an Associate Professor in the section for Human-Computer Interaction & Design at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU). I’m a computer scientist with research interests in human-computer interaction, psychology, and data science. My research is about understanding user behavior of computer systems, and what this tells us about human psychology. My work entails designing and conducting computerized experiments with human participants, and modeling the interactions using statistical and machine learning techniques. I’m studying, and ultimately aiming at improving, how to conduct empirical research in computer science. I utilize a range of technologies such as extended reality and mobile interfaces to evaluate, understand, and improve the study of interactions between humans and computers at scale. I am a fan of open science and reproducibility.
