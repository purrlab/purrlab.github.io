title: Laura Weihl
description: Laura Weihl is a PhD student with a background in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Machine Learning, specialising in enhancing underwater vision systems. Her research primarily revolves around advancing perception of static underwater cameras and autonomous underwater vehicles. Her recent work includes leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D reconstructions to create testing environments for visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) and applying transfer learning techniques to detect and analyze seagrass in underwater footage.
Driven by a growing interest in environmental conservation, she is now focusing on how these technologies can be used for biodiversity monitoring to assess and support environmental health. When not immersed in code, you can find her playing piano or singing in a choir, blending art with science to explore the depths of both the ocean and human expression.
