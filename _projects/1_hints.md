<h2>Description</h2>

In this project we investigate how "hints" - additional annotations of the visual content of the image - can help medical image classification. We have shown that in skin lesion classification, annotations of high-level properties such as asymmetry of the lesion, can be used in multi-task learning to improve the robustness of the algorithm. Additionally, such annotations may help for the algorithms to be more explainable.
